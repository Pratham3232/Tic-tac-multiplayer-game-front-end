## 🎮 Key Changes

### Before (Chess)
```typescript

import { Chess } from 'chess.js';

const [chess] = useState(new Chess());
const [position, setPosition] = useState(chess.fen());

<Chessboard
  position={position}
  onPieceDrop={onDrop}
/>
```

### After (Tic-Tac-Toe)
```typescript
const [board, setBoard] = useState<(string | null)[]>(Array(9).fill(null));

const handleCellClick = (index: number) => {
  // Place X or O in cell
};

<div className="grid grid-cols-3">
  {[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].map(index => (
    <button onClick={() => handleCellClick(index)}>
      {board[index]}
    </button>
  ))}
</div>
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Game State
```typescript
{
  _id: "67890abc...",
  id: "67890abc...",
  whitePlayer: { id: "123", username: "Player1" },  // X
  blackPlayer: { id: "456", username: "Player2" },  // O
  currentTurn: "white",  // or "black"
  status: "in_progress",  // or "waiting", "completed"
  currentPosition: '["X","O",null,"X",null,null,null,null,null]',
  moves: [
    { from: "0", to: "0", piece: "X" },
    { from: "1", to: "1", piece: "O" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Move Flow
```
User clicks cell
  ↓
Validate (empty, in_progress, correct turn)
  ↓
Send via WebSocket: { from: "4", to: "4", piece: "X" }
  ↓
Backend validates & updates
  ↓
Broadcast to both players
  ↓
Both UIs update instantly
```
